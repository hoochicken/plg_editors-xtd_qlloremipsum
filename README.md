Insert dummie text ipsum into article

We devs know it so well. We want to finish a website structure, and we're stuck copy'n'paste-ing dummie texts like "lorem ipsum" ansd so on.Farewell, copy'n'paste!

The lorem ipsum extension is an editor plugin, which inserts the lorem ipsum text or any text you want to add. For the text to be inserted is editable.

By the way: you can "abuse" the plugin for entering any text, including plugin tags {}. So this extension might really help you;-)
